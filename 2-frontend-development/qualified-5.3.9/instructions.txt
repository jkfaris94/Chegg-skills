React state management: Complex forms
Instructions
Build the RSVPForm component in RSVPForm.jsx to be a form with the following fields, in this order:

Name input field.
Dropdown with the following age ranges: Prefer not to say, 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60+.
New Member checkbox, set to unchecked by default.
Comment input field.
Submit button.
Upon submission, log each value together, in a single statement, to the console, and clear the fields in the form.

Example
For example, imagine the following is inputted into the form:

Name: John
Age: 60+
New Member: checked
Comment: left empty
The following should be what is logged to the console.

"John", "60+", true, ""
Note: Remember that you can log multiple items by passing multiple arguments into a console.log() statement, such as console.log("John", "60+").
