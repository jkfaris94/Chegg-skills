        q: {What is React?}
        a: {React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            It uses a component-based architecture, so instead of managing one big HTML file, we break the UI into smaller, reusable pieces.
            React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the page that change, which makes it fast.
            Developers can also use features like useState and useEffect—called hooks—to manage state and side effects in functional components.}

    [
        q: {what are props?}
        a: {Props in React are short for "properties."
            They are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props make components reusable by letting them accept dynamic input.
            Props are read-only, meaning a component can use them but can't change them directly.}

        q: {What is the DOM?}
        a: {The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a tree-like representation of a webpage’s structure.
            Each element in the HTML becomes a node in the DOM tree. JavaScript can use the DOM to read and manipulate page content dynamically.
            For example, we can change the text of an element or respond to user actions using JavaScript by targeting DOM nodes.}

        q: {what is the virtual DOM?}
        a: {The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM.
            In React, when there are changes to state or props, React updates the virtual DOM first. 
            Then, it compares it to the previous version using a process called reconciliation. 
            After finding the differences, React efficiently updates only the parts of the real DOM that changed.}
    ]
    [
        q: {what is state?}
        a: { State in React is a built-in object that holds data or information about the component.
            When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new data.
            Unlike props (which are passed in), state is managed within the component itself.}
