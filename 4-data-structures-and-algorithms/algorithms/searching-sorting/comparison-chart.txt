Even a perfectly sorted input requires scanning the entire array.

Insertion

Stable
In the best case (already sorted), every insert requires constant time.

Heap
O(n log n)
O(n log n)
O(n log n)
Constant
Not stable
By using an input array as storage for the heap, it is possible to achieve constant space.

Merge
O(n log n)
O(n log n)
O(n log n)
Depends
Stable
On arrays, merge sort requires O(n) space. But on linked lists, merge sort requires 
constant space.

Constant
Not stable
To avoid worst-case scenarios, it can help to pick a pivot value at random or shuffle the 
array before running the quicksort algorithm.
