ðŸ”¹ Saturday Challenge â€“ CRUD with Axios
Goal: Practice making API requests and destructuring responses.

Prompt:
Create a small app using the JSONPlaceholder API that can:

Fetch all posts and log their titles.

Fetch a specific post by postId = 3 and log the title and body.

Create a new post and log the created object.

Update post id = 1 with a new title.

Delete post id = 2.

Bonus:
Wrap each action in its own async function and use try/catch to handle errors.

ðŸ”¹ Sunday Challenge â€“ Array Methods Mastery
Goal: Apply map, filter, find, and reduce to real-world data.

Prompt:
Fetch all users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

Use map() to return an array of just the names.

Use filter() to return users who live in a city that starts with "S".

Use find() to locate the user whose username is "Bret".

Use reduce() to build an object counting how many users live in each city.

Bonus:
Chain methods together and explain the result of each step.

ðŸ”¹ Monday Challenge â€“ Mock Interview Simulation
Goal: Bring it all together under time pressure (30 minutes max).

Prompt:
Build a small getUserPosts(userId) function that:

Accepts a userId.

Fetches all posts.

Filters posts where userId matches.

Maps over them to return an array of { id, title }.

Handles errors gracefully.
